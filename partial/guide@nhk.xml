For that reason it became known as &quot;the port for awaiting the tide&quot; and was even mentioned in the Manyoshu, a collection of Japanese poems collated some 1,200 years ago. Tom Miyagawa Coulton is a photographer who lives on an island in the Seto Inland Sea.

Yet not long after, 40 of those satellites fell out of orbit and burned up upon re-entry into the Earth&apos;s atmosphere. Similar accidents have occurred frequently in the past. The cause of such incidents is believed to be solar flares, huge explosions that occur on the sun&apos;s surface. Solar flares can also lead to other disasters that threaten our daily lives, such as major power outages, radio interference, and communication problems for airplanes and ships. Why do solar flares occur? We&apos;ll visit some researchers in Japan that are working hard to understand their mechanism and predict future occurrences.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/2090018/images/wide_l_dIQfChv7bwvx7m31OjOqy2Etc68gVV3kZfRiHFfy.jpg</image></programme>

It occupies an important location because this is the point where the tides from each end of the Inland Sea meet. In the old days, ships had to wait here until the ebb tide, before continuing their journeys. For that reason it became known as &quot;the port for awaiting the tide&quot; and was even mentioned in the Manyoshu, a collection of Japanese poems collated some 1,200 years ago. Tom Miyagawa Coulton is a photographer who lives on an island in the Seto Inland Sea. On this episode of Journeys in Japan, Tom explores the historic town of Tomonoura and discovers the town&apos;s centuries-old tradition of forging steel. He also meets the local people who have protected this town and kept their community ties with love and care.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/2007525/images/wide_l_ReBRglZhYt9kkLhzP6hNRyuvGpUOvQ7OEM2vhLtB.jpg</image></programme>

In areas that have sought to coexist with foreigners, things are starting to go wrong, with some residents saying, &quot;Originally, we didn&apos;t have any particular complaints, but now we&apos;re starting to feel anxious because of what we see on social media.&quot; On the other hand, we also spoke with companies exploring the possibility of not being able to function without foreign workers. We consider how Japan should deal with its ever-increasing number of resident non-nationals.

It occupies an important location because this is the point where the tides from each end of the Inland Sea meet. In the old days, ships had to wait here until the ebb tide, before continuing their journeys. For that reason it became known as &quot;the port for awaiting the tide&quot; and was even mentioned in the Manyoshu, a collection of Japanese poems collated some 1,200 years ago. Tom Miyagawa Coulton is a photographer who lives on an island in the Seto Inland Sea. On this episode of Journeys in Japan, Tom explores the historic town of Tomonoura and discovers the town&apos;s centuries-old tradition of forging steel. He also meets the local people who have protected this town and kept their community ties with love and care.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/2007525/images/wide_l_ReBRglZhYt9kkLhzP6hNRyuvGpUOvQ7OEM2vhLtB.jpg</image></programme>
