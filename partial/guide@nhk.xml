It&apos;s famous for its traditional thatched-roof Gassho-style homes. The triangular roofs distribute the weight of heavy snow evenly, and the steep slopes allow residents to remove snow with little effort. Hearth fires provide heat that dries out thatch and soot that blackens pillars and beams. These homes have lasted for so long because they are still inhabited. The cooperative bond between residents is a key part of life here and is essential when rethatching these homes. Come and visit a mountain village that appears to be frozen in time.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/6214012/images/wide_l_k8it9xBEZ0kA7gm5nxTce2zjQtTgTBaQWzq5okDh.jpg</image></programme>

While the overall amount of snowfall per winter has been decreasing year by year, the amount of snow that falls at one time is conversely increasing. What role does climate change play in this? It turns out that rising temperatures have led to more water vapor in the Sea of Japan, and interaction with a weather phenomenon called JPCZ has subsequently brought on heavy snow.

Hearth fires provide heat that dries out thatch and soot that blackens pillars and beams. These homes have lasted for so long because they are still inhabited. The cooperative bond between residents is a key part of life here and is essential when rethatching these homes.

The triangular roofs distribute the weight of heavy snow evenly, and the steep slopes allow residents to remove snow with little effort. Hearth fires provide heat that dries out thatch and soot that blackens pillars and beams. These homes have lasted for so long because they are still inhabited. The cooperative bond between residents is a key part of life here and is essential when rethatching these homes.

It&apos;s famous for its traditional thatched-roof Gassho-style homes. The triangular roofs distribute the weight of heavy snow evenly, and the steep slopes allow residents to remove snow with little effort. Hearth fires provide heat that dries out thatch and soot that blackens pillars and beams. These homes have lasted for so long because they are still inhabited. The cooperative bond between residents is a key part of life here and is essential when rethatching these homes.
