Hearth fires provide heat that dries out thatch and soot that blackens pillars and beams. These homes have lasted for so long because they are still inhabited. The cooperative bond between residents is a key part of life here and is essential when rethatching these homes.

It&apos;s famous for its traditional thatched-roof Gassho-style homes. The triangular roofs distribute the weight of heavy snow evenly, and the steep slopes allow residents to remove snow with little effort. Hearth fires provide heat that dries out thatch and soot that blackens pillars and beams. These homes have lasted for so long because they are still inhabited. The cooperative bond between residents is a key part of life here and is essential when rethatching these homes.
