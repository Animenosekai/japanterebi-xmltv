While many remain confident in the safety of their driving, their families often become concerned with the decline in their cognitive and physical functions. Should they keep their driver&apos;s license or give it up? It&apos;s a question given added urgency by a spate of accidents involving older drivers. Researchers are hoping to provide an answer with a new body of data-driven work that has given rise to the idea of the &quot;driving lifespan&quot; - the years during which someone can continue to safely operate a vehicle. We take a look at what the latest science shows and ask an expert what people can do to extend their driving lifespan as much as possible.

The triangular roofs distribute the weight of heavy snow evenly, and the steep slopes allow residents to remove snow with little effort. Hearth fires provide heat that dries out thatch and soot that blackens pillars and beams. These homes have lasted for so long because they are still inhabited. The cooperative bond between residents is a key part of life here and is essential when rethatching these homes.
