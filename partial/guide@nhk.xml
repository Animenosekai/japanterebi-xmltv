The deity of Onomichi&apos;s Ikkyu Shrine descends from a mountain, carried in a mikoshi and accompanied by three oni, or ogres. First celebrated in 1807, this matsuri began as a way to drive away an epidemic, and so the continuing impact of COVID-19 gave the event special significance in 2022. Masked figures carry sticks with which to &quot;torment&quot; spectators. But being hit or poked with a stick is actually said to bring good fortune.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/6126014/images/wide_l_L92x3dBKZcJACwBBs6O3YOmMV0wyW4os4jz7ktmx.jpg</image></programme>
