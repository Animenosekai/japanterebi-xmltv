Then in 2023, the market exploded to life as investment money started pouring into new condos.

The result has been a sharp rise in prices there, too, leaving many renters in a precarious financial position. We look at what one municipal government in Tokyo is doing to counter the trend, and ask experts how residents can find an affordable place to live.

The city later came under Dutch rule in the 17th century, followed by British control in the 19th century. Despite these shifts in colonial rulers, Melaka continued to prosper as a significant port town.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/4017150/images/wide_l_ffABWybXWjec6zRzJbwpxISdkjG38lsTOWFT2oi2.jpg</image></programme>
