He also visits a Buddhist temple, Soji-ji Soin, which suffered significant damage, and sees how the priests are restoring this essential pillar of the community. He then travels to Suzu City on the far tip of the peninsula, where he is astonished by the changes he finds to the natural landscape. He is also struck by the warmth of the staff at the Suzu Horse Park, who are working to provide healing for the local people through their interactions with the horses.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/2007573/images/wide_l_uO74vNWIjOFWk4KExRoX8MNvclclBc8sjGJMN2W1.jpg</image></programme>

Residents rely on this store as a source of fresh food and basic necessities, especially in midwinter. Among the customers were a woman who uses a sled to carry her shopping home; an octopus fisherman who shops there three times a day; and a hair stylist who knows everybody in Shosanbetsu. For three days as a blizzard buffeted the area, we spoke to the store&apos;s customers to get a glimpse at life in this village.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/4026196/images/wide_l_fW7j155n46VbIGURFKaeKNEYb9PXip1ZqgDzjoy0.jpg</image></programme>

Shunsuke SHIGAKI, an assistant professor at Osaka University, seeks to address the problem by analyzing the scent-detection abilities of silk moths. To understand how airflow or sight affect their perception of scents, he built a VR unit for insects in order to gather data. The algorithm created from it allowed him to program a robot with similar odor-detection capabilities. Now, he attempts to give it enough environmental adaptability to navigate obstacles, or operate outdoors. In this episode, we follow SHIGAKI&apos;s efforts to create a high-tech robot with abilities learned from actual organisms, so that it might eventually be put to use in search and rescue operations.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/2015287/images/wide_l_M1O1Z3B6mUjELbeNzuQJK0rJjqBK6Dosa0gpXoI2.jpg</image></programme>

On this edition of Journeys in Japan, Kyle Card visits two of the worst-hit areas, to meet the people of Noto and see how they are starting to bounce back from tragedy and devastation. In Wajima, he meets people from the city&apos;s iconic Morning Market, who are working vigorously at a temporary location. And he meets with artisans who are keeping alive the traditions of Wajima-nuri lacquerware. He also visits a Buddhist temple, Soji-ji Soin, which suffered significant damage, and sees how the priests are restoring this essential pillar of the community. He then travels to Suzu City on the far tip of the peninsula, where he is astonished by the changes he finds to the natural landscape. He is also struck by the warmth of the staff at the Suzu Horse Park, who are working to provide healing for the local people through their interactions with the horses.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/2007573/images/wide_l_uO74vNWIjOFWk4KExRoX8MNvclclBc8sjGJMN2W1.jpg</image></programme>

These residences offer a level of comfort and care unavailable at nursing homes, and they are spreading rapidly at a time when hospital capacity is declining across the country. But they also present serious challenges. The quality of care varies dramatically by residence, and some operators have been known to overcharge for medical care. We talk to experts about the merits of hospice-style housing and what needs to be done to improve the system.

Residents rely on this store as a source of fresh food and basic necessities, especially in midwinter. Among the customers were a woman who uses a sled to carry her shopping home; an octopus fisherman who shops there three times a day; and a hair stylist who knows everybody in Shosanbetsu. For three days as a blizzard buffeted the area, we spoke to the store&apos;s customers to get a glimpse at life in this village.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/4026196/images/wide_l_fW7j155n46VbIGURFKaeKNEYb9PXip1ZqgDzjoy0.jpg</image></programme>

Shunsuke SHIGAKI, an assistant professor at Osaka University, seeks to address the problem by analyzing the scent-detection abilities of silk moths. To understand how airflow or sight affect their perception of scents, he built a VR unit for insects in order to gather data. The algorithm created from it allowed him to program a robot with similar odor-detection capabilities. Now, he attempts to give it enough environmental adaptability to navigate obstacles, or operate outdoors. In this episode, we follow SHIGAKI&apos;s efforts to create a high-tech robot with abilities learned from actual organisms, so that it might eventually be put to use in search and rescue operations.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/2015287/images/wide_l_M1O1Z3B6mUjELbeNzuQJK0rJjqBK6Dosa0gpXoI2.jpg</image></programme>

On this edition of Journeys in Japan, Kyle Card visits two of the worst-hit areas, to meet the people of Noto and see how they are starting to bounce back from tragedy and devastation. In Wajima, he meets people from the city&apos;s iconic Morning Market, who are working vigorously at a temporary location. And he meets with artisans who are keeping alive the traditions of Wajima-nuri lacquerware. He also visits a Buddhist temple, Soji-ji Soin, which suffered significant damage, and sees how the priests are restoring this essential pillar of the community. He then travels to Suzu City on the far tip of the peninsula, where he is astonished by the changes he finds to the natural landscape. He is also struck by the warmth of the staff at the Suzu Horse Park, who are working to provide healing for the local people through their interactions with the horses.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/2007573/images/wide_l_uO74vNWIjOFWk4KExRoX8MNvclclBc8sjGJMN2W1.jpg</image></programme>

Shunsuke SHIGAKI, an assistant professor at Osaka University, seeks to address the problem by analyzing the scent-detection abilities of silk moths. To understand how airflow or sight affect their perception of scents, he built a VR unit for insects in order to gather data. The algorithm created from it allowed him to program a robot with similar odor-detection capabilities. Now, he attempts to give it enough environmental adaptability to navigate obstacles, or operate outdoors. In this episode, we follow SHIGAKI&apos;s efforts to create a high-tech robot with abilities learned from actual organisms, so that it might eventually be put to use in search and rescue operations.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/2015287/images/wide_l_M1O1Z3B6mUjELbeNzuQJK0rJjqBK6Dosa0gpXoI2.jpg</image></programme>
