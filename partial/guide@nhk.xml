In an average year it gets as much as five meters of snow, and that means it can offer runs found in few other parts of the country. These days people come from around the world to find out what makes this resort special. They start their day with some fresh tracks, taking the gondola to the top ahead of the official opening time when the slopes are covered with pristine snow. They enjoy tree runs with deep powder snow through wooded areas that are usually off-limits at other ski resorts. And they head out for some backcountry skiing along with accredited guides. On this episode, Michael Keida and his wife Kumiko take full advantage of the JAPOW conditions at this gosetsu paradise.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/2007523/images/wide_l_7RYv3ZZdZMJPWKCbRim8Rj2tkmsvB6WpEnjLNGsX.jpg</image></programme>

Then in 2023, the market exploded to life as investment money started pouring into new condos. In many cases, buyers are rapidly reselling for profit, a practice that&apos;s driving prices skyward and pushing house-hunters toward the used market or rentals. The result has been a sharp rise in prices there, too, leaving many renters in a precarious financial position. We look at what one municipal government in Tokyo is doing to counter the trend, and ask experts how residents can find an affordable place to live.

Stretching 80 kilometers from north to south, the Kisoji is home to 11 &quot;post towns&quot; along its trail. The road has been used for about 400 years, with feudal lords from all over Japan using it to get to Tokyo to serve the shogun during the Samurai period. In this episode, we tour the post towns and see the deep facets of the Kisoji route.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/2024144/images/wide_l_BH9hugX1XdUGeX0j0tXgaWiDocueU5n137IdsFjM.jpg</image></programme>

In an average year it gets as much as five meters of snow, and that means it can offer runs found in few other parts of the country. These days people come from around the world to find out what makes this resort special. They start their day with some fresh tracks, taking the gondola to the top ahead of the official opening time when the slopes are covered with pristine snow. They enjoy tree runs with deep powder snow through wooded areas that are usually off-limits at other ski resorts. And they head out for some backcountry skiing along with accredited guides. On this episode, Michael Keida and his wife Kumiko take full advantage of the JAPOW conditions at this gosetsu paradise.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/2007523/images/wide_l_7RYv3ZZdZMJPWKCbRim8Rj2tkmsvB6WpEnjLNGsX.jpg</image></programme>

In this special program we look at the behind-the-scenes of how this performance was created. Most of the hearing actors had never worked with Deaf actors before, so it brought about a new challenge. During rehearsals, the cast underwent a process of trial and error as they examined each other&apos;s lines in sign language and verbal Japanese trying to coordinate their timing, with mixed results. Deaf actors and directors dug deep until the very last minute of filming to determine what sign language expressions were best suited for Shakespeare&apos;s eloquence. In the process, the entire crew discovered what it means for the two groups of actors to work together in this unprecedented artistic experiment.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/3025051/images/wide_l_QPhQ96KKM5NbdqLg20BmdM8lapmwKHWEgEhXaeQl.jpg</image></programme>
