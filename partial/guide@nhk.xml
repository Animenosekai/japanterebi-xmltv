It occupies an important location because this is the point where the tides from each end of the Inland Sea meet. In the old days, ships had to wait here until the ebb tide, before continuing their journeys. For that reason it became known as &quot;the port for awaiting the tide&quot; and was even mentioned in the Manyoshu, a collection of Japanese poems collated some 1,200 years ago. Tom Miyagawa Coulton is a photographer who lives on an island in the Seto Inland Sea. On this episode of Journeys in Japan, Tom explores the historic town of Tomonoura and discovers the town&apos;s centuries-old tradition of forging steel. He also meets the local people who have protected this town and kept their community ties with love and care.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/2007525/images/wide_l_ReBRglZhYt9kkLhzP6hNRyuvGpUOvQ7OEM2vhLtB.jpg</image></programme>

In areas that have sought to coexist with foreigners, things are starting to go wrong, with some residents saying, &quot;Originally, we didn&apos;t have any particular complaints, but now we&apos;re starting to feel anxious because of what we see on social media.&quot; On the other hand, we also spoke with companies exploring the possibility of not being able to function without foreign workers.

It has long been known as a high-fiber, diet-friendly food, and in recent years it&apos;s been shown to offer health benefits such as reducing the risk of dementia and lowering blood sugar levels. Konnyaku is a chewy, jelly-like food made from the extremely bitter corm of the konjac plant. How is it processed? And what other uses does it have? We observe how it&apos;s made and look at the many dishes that incorporate this surprising food.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/6032044/images/wide_l_5y8QbkdbllrbUeQIqXxlZfuSkfstCPe4rv3lDRns.jpg</image></programme>
