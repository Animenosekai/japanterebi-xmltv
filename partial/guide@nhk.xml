Then in 2023, the market exploded to life as investment money started pouring into new condos. In many cases, buyers are rapidly reselling for profit, a practice that&apos;s driving prices skyward and pushing house-hunters toward the used market or rentals. The result has been a sharp rise in prices there, too, leaving many renters in a precarious financial position. We look at what one municipal government in Tokyo is doing to counter the trend, and ask experts how residents can find an affordable place to live.

In an average year it gets as much as five meters of snow, and that means it can offer runs found in few other parts of the country. These days people come from around the world to find out what makes this resort special. They start their day with some fresh tracks, taking the gondola to the top ahead of the official opening time when the slopes are covered with pristine snow. They enjoy tree runs with deep powder snow through wooded areas that are usually off-limits at other ski resorts. And they head out for some backcountry skiing along with accredited guides. On this episode, Michael Keida and his wife Kumiko take full advantage of the JAPOW conditions at this gosetsu paradise.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/2007523/images/wide_l_7RYv3ZZdZMJPWKCbRim8Rj2tkmsvB6WpEnjLNGsX.jpg</image></programme>

In an average year it gets as much as five meters of snow, and that means it can offer runs found in few other parts of the country. These days people come from around the world to find out what makes this resort special. They start their day with some fresh tracks, taking the gondola to the top ahead of the official opening time when the slopes are covered with pristine snow. They enjoy tree runs with deep powder snow through wooded areas that are usually off-limits at other ski resorts. And they head out for some backcountry skiing along with accredited guides. On this episode, Michael Keida and his wife Kumiko take full advantage of the JAPOW conditions at this gosetsu paradise.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/2007523/images/wide_l_7RYv3ZZdZMJPWKCbRim8Rj2tkmsvB6WpEnjLNGsX.jpg</image></programme>
