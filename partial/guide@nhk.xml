At the Adachi Museum of Art, visitors will find one of the finest examples in all Japan. Over the centuries, the region has developed a profound and distinctive culture, which is reflected in its &quot;Izumo-style&quot; gardens, as well as a less formal approach to the tea ceremony that was embraced by the local populace. On this edition of Journeys in Japan, Sheila Cliffe explores a range of different Japanese gardens, to discover the sensibility and depth that underlies Shimane&apos;s garden culture.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/2007570/images/wide_l_dTYXpdFO2LWzgQt39AMCG4Nq7sk6gphepJiXUIuI.jpg</image></programme>

One torch is taken to the river, where the oni conducts a ritual that cleanses people of their troubles.

Six giant torches, measuring 13 meters and weighing 1.2 tons, are moved around a shrine precinct. They create a shadow in which the oni can emerge. One torch is taken to the river, where the oni conducts a ritual that cleanses people of their troubles. This matsuri also recounts a 1,600-year-old story about a local hero defeating an outlaw—who goes on to become the oni.</desc><image>https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/shows/matsuri_japan/images/wide_l_GxWlWvlyNl9pVoI56cC9KGA3oEFcCh9EBN5hbq2Z.jpg</image></programme>
